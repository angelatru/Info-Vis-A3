                    <b>Overfishing</b> is one of the largest threats endangering the population of marine life. We are 
                    fishing so much that the ocean has trouble keeping up, unable to naturally replenish at the 
                    rate we are fishing. Fisheries around the world are continuously being pushed beyond limit, 
                    at the point of collapse for some. A major reason for overfishing becoming a global problem 
                    is due to poor fisheries management, and <b>Illegal, Unreported and Unregulated fishing.</b>

                <h3>Fish Consumption & Trade</h3>
    
                <p>
                    Let's look at the trend in the consumption of fish in the world and how it has changed overtime. 
                </p>

                <!-- -->

                <p>
                    Overall, the world is eating more seafood per capita with the forerunners of consumption being Iceland, 
                    The Maldives, and Hong Kong in 2017. 
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    With more demand for fish as well as technological advancements to 
                    how we catch fish, more workers are needed to supply for the demand. As such, there has been a boom in the
                    industry of fisheries and aquaculture, <b>increasing by 60%</b> since 1995.
                </p>

                    <b>Aquaculture</b> refers to the regulated growth (breeding) of aquatic animals and aquatic plants, using or within 
                    freshwater, sea water, brackish water and inland saline water. The growth of the world's aquaculture industry
                    is hailed by East Asia and the Pacific, notably China, which in 2015 produced 61 million tonnes. 
                </p>

                <div id="chart-aq-production" class="data-chart-choropleth" ></div>
                <!-- -->

                <p>
                    The growth in aquaculture over the millennia has made it possible to increase global seafood production 
                    without sacrificing fish stocks. Production continues to grow while the output of wild fishering has slowed, 
                    allowing us to maintain sustainable fishing levels that do not put fish populations at risk.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    Despite the growth in aquaculture and sustainable breeding, it is still a fact that still today, 
                    illegal fishing within fisheries - which focus on wild catch or producing and collecting fish - 
                    continue to be the driving factor of depleting fish stocks across the world.

                <h3>Fish Stocks & Health</h3>
                <br>
                <h4><b>As of 2017, 34% of global fish stocks are overfished.</b></h4>
                <br>
                <p>
                    <b>Sustainable fishing</b> refers to catching fish at a pace where the stock can naturally reproduce without 
                    reducing population, resulting in being able to catch as many fish as possible. Overfishing on the other 
                    hand is where we catch fish faster than they can reproduce. In turn, reducing populations and depleting 
                    stocks gradually as we fish at a rigorous pace. Overfishing is more prevalent in wild catch fisheries as 
                    the management of fisheries around the world is not well overseen.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Health of fish stocks refers to the <b>biomass</b> of certain fish stocks, essentially, <b>the amount of wild 
                    fish</b> in the ocean. <b>The Maximum Sustainable Yield</b> is known as the <b>"sweet spot"</b> for catching fish whereby 
                    the rate of reproduction and catch is equal. The value of one in the chart is optimal for the "sweet spot". 
                    A value below one means that the fish stocks are lower than the rate we are catching them, resulting in 
                    a potential gradual decline in fish population. 
                </p>

                <h3>The Good News</h3>
    
                <p>
                    Although the sustainability of global fishery resources continues to decline, the decline is at a much 
                    reduced state than the past. Improved regulation and effective monitoring of Illegal, Unreported and 
                    Unregulated fishing has proven successful in reverting overfished populations back to sustainable levels - 
                    as seen from recent tuna stocks. Unfortunately, the adoption of these regulations have been slow, particularly in developing countries. 
                </p>

                <p>
                    These better management of fisheries that have been prevalent in the last millenia positively impacted 
                    the total fish stocks of the world. There is an upward trend in multiple fish 
                    health and stocks - particularly tuna -, showcasing the progression towards sustainable fishing . On average, scientifically-assessed 
                    fish populations around the world are healthy or improving. And, for fish populations that are not doing 
                    well, there is a clear roadmap to sustainability.

                <p>
                    Organisations across the globe are continuously taking on the necessity of sustainable fishery management, 
                    keeping the oceans ample with fish. What you can do is be aware and choose certified sustainable seafood
                    such as the <a class="text-link" href="https://www.msc.org/">Marine Stewardship Council (MSC)</a> and 
                    <a class="text-link" href="http://www.asc-aqua.org/">Aquaculture Stewardship Council (ASC)</a>. 
                    You can also help organisations directly by taking action alongside them such as volunteering or help fund 
                    them by donating what you can.
